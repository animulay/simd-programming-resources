## simd-programming-resources
A collection of various SIMD related books, blogs, videos, code repos

I recently started learning & exploring [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction%2C_multiple_data) programming. This repository is meant to record and organize various resources for quick reference. Hopefully, others may also find it useful.
